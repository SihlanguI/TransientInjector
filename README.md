# TransientInjector
This project focuses on simulating and injecting transient astronomical sources into high-time-cadence Zarr cubes derived from MeerKAT radio telescope data. By modeling transient sources and incorporating them into existing observational data, the project aims to test and refine transient detection algorithms.
